# The Hornet Engine
Hornet is an amateur graphics/input API that has as main focus Tangible Interface development for beginners and professionals. This engine is written on top of popular libraries like Silk.Net, Glm and Assimp and provides a layer abstraction for users to create their own Tangible Interface.


## Goals
For a long time there has not been an open-source framework available to the public for making Tangible
Interfaces possible. A few corporate frameworks already exist but those frameworks are not available to the public
without spending large sums of money.
This framework offers an open source option in tangible interface development.


## How to install
Thanks to the short project scope and small dev team, the project does not have a page on NuGet yet. 
A static project reference is required to implement this framework into your project.

1. Copy the HornetEngine folder to your project
2. In visual studio, go to "Solution">"Add">"Existing Project"
3. Select the "HornetEngine.csproj" file within the copied HornetEngine
4. In visual studio, click on your project and click "Add">"Project Reference"
5. Tick the Hornet Engine selection box and click apply
6. Hornet Engine is ready to use now!
7. Make sure you have the NuGet libraries and correct version installed as shown in the image below
